        <description>Sequences is a port of Scala's Stream[+A] to C#.

A Sequence&lt;T&gt; is an immutable lazy list whose elements are only evaluated when they are needed. A sequence is composed by a head (the first element) and a lazily-evaluated tail (the remaining elements).

The fact that the tail is lazily-evaluated, makes it easy to represent infinite series or sets. 

See the project's page for examples: https://github.com/dcastro/Sequences</description>
        <summary>Sequences is a port of Scala's Streams to C#. It features lazy evaluation, immutability and memoization.</summary>
        <releaseNotes>- Improved iterators to allow a more efficient garbage collection;
- Added IndexOfSlice and ContainsSlice.</releaseNotes>
